language: python
# We explicity specify the build matrix here. This is to match the notional
# "default" Python to the tox environment. In reality this shouldn't matter
# since tox creates its own isolated environment independent of the system
# Python. Pragmatically, however, it's nice to have the "language" column on
# Travis match the version of Python we're testing against rather than the
# only matching the version of Python used to run the test runner.
# See: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Build-Matrix
